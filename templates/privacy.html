    <p>We can and will ban you from the site if you fail to follow these terms. We may also take legal action against

    <p>We can remove any content whenever we feel like it for any reason at all, with or without notifying the content owner.</p>
    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>We have made a lot of efforts to preserve your privacy, while still giving the administration the ability to issue
    bans and take action against abuse. With that in mind, the only thing we keep around that you cannot opt-out of is
    your IP address (in addition to the account information you may voluntarily enter on the site).</p>
